**Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivanildo Schattevoo, an aspiring data engineering who loves working with Python and SQL. 

On this Github account, I will add some of my personal projects and assignments related to data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning.

**About me**

My current role as a policy officer at the Ministry of Finance has exposed me to the power of data analytics.
This exposure has ignited a strong interest in data science, with a particular focus on ETL processes and their ability to shape efficient data pipelines. 
Moving forward, I'm eager to transition into a career as a skilled data engineer, where I can apply my technical skills to tackle real-world problems and work on exciting projects that make a tangible impact.

**Skills**

- Python programming
- SQL database design and querying
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process development
- Data modeling and schema design
- Data warehousing and business intelligence

Thanks for visiting my GitHub repository! 
Although there are no projects here yet, I'm hard at work developing a range of data engineering solutions that I can't wait to share with you. 
Watch this space for exciting updates soon!
